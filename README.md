**Predictive Modeling Pipeline for Audience Rating Prediction**

The "Predictive Modeling Pipeline for Audience Rating Prediction" project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict audience ratings for movies, TV shows, or other media content. 
The goal is to create a system that can analyze past data, such as user demographics, content features, and viewing history, to predict how future audiences will rate new content. 
The project typically involves data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment in a pipeline format. 
The predictive model can then be used to enhance content recommendations, marketing strategies, and content creation by understanding audience preferences.


**Overview**

This project aims to build a predictive model for predicting audience ratings based on a given dataset. The pipeline includes:

Data Loading and Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model Building (including preprocessing and training)

Hyperparameter Tuning

Saving the Model Pipeline

**Steps Involved**

**1. Load the Dataset**
   
The first step in this project is loading the dataset from an Excel file. Error handling is implemented to ensure that if any issue occurs during data loading, itâ€™s captured.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   
Once the dataset is loaded, exploratory data analysis is performed. This includes examining the dataset's basic structure, identifying missing values, generating summary statistics, and visualizing correlations and distributions of variables.

**Summary statistics** give insights into the data.

**Missing values** are identified to ensure data integrity.

**Correlation matrix** and **target distribution** visualizations help in understanding relationships between features and the target variable, i.e., audience_rating

**3. Saving the Model Pipeline**
   
Once the model is trained, the entire pipeline (including preprocessing steps and the model) is saved to disk using joblib for future use and inference.

**4. Running the Pipeline**

In the final step, the main script loads the dataset, performs EDA, builds the model pipeline, and saves the trained model.
